# car_rl
Reinforcement autonomous driving project of Kovan Lab.

# AutonomousCar 

In this project we have built a driving algorithm in ROS2 that follows a lane. 

TODO List For Near Future:
   - Start using model predictive control for lane following.
   - Implement a geometric intersection algorithm for constructing valid areas for the robot to go.
   - Implement several ways to provide explicit geometric fences for the vehicle.
   - Find or implement a faster lane detection algorithm.
